## Introduction

In a bear market, everyone wants to be selling the utility of shovels and pickaxes. 

Pickaxe is Tessellated's utility library for Go based functionality on blockchains. 

## Usage

This library probably isn't particularly useful to external developers, but it is open source so that our other software can be built with it.

## Installation

Simply run the following to update your `go.mod` file:

```
go get github.com/tessellated-io/pickaxe
```
